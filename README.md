## How to use

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in your preferred IDE.
- Set the project JDK to 21 if prompted.
- Run the application with JavaFX using the `mvn clean compile javafx:run` command (IntelliJ: Hit ctrl twice to open the Run Anything popup), or via the Maven plugin in your IDE.
- The application will start, and you can begin using it.

If you encounter any issues launching or persisting data, try deleting the `data` folder in the root directory of the project and relaunching the application.
This will reset the database.
